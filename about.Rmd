![Evolution of Avery](/img/avery_graph.jpg)

I created the above graphic in June 2019 when the BYU-Idaho Data Science Society
presidency attended a R/tidyverse workshop given by Garrett Grolemund,
co-author of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). 

## Evolution of Avery

The inception of this website marks about two years since I started programming in R. The ultimate goal of this project is to create a space to share what I have learned, and what I am learning, with regards to data science programming. All this in hopes to make your life a little bit easier.

I love R, and I appreciate the things that people have done to add to the language. It is an extremely powerful environment for statistical analysis, reproducible work, and data wrangling & visualization. As I continue to develop skills in other languages, like Python and SQL, I hope to add content directed towards those areas as well.

Truthfully, the creation of this website marks a great victory over procrastination.
Hopefully you are not reading this while procrastinating some project of your own.
If you are, please stop! Go and do that thing that you know you should be doing!
It is definitely worth it. Otherwise, feel free to check out one of my posts. Happy coding!

If you are both an R user and a fan of *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, check out 
my simple R package [appa](https://github.com/averyrobbins1/appa) and have fun
with transcript data from perhaps the greatest animated show ever created.
