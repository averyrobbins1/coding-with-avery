The ultimate goal of this project is to create a space to share what I have learned, and what I am learning, with regards to data science programming. All this in hopes to make your life a little bit easier.\r\nI love R, and I appreciate the things that people have done to add to the language. It is an extremely powerful environment for statistical analysis, reproducible work, and data wrangling & visualization. As I continue to develop skills in other languages, like Python and SQL, I hope to add content directed towards those areas as well.\r\nTruthfully, the creation of this website marks a great victory over procrastination. Hopefully you are not reading this while procrastinating some project of your own. If you are, please stop! Go and do that thing that you know you should be doing! It is definitely worth it. Otherwise, feel free to check out one of my posts. Happy coding!\r\nIf you are both an R user and a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, check out my simple R package appa and have fun with transcript data from perhaps the greatest animated show ever created.\r\nIf you are interested in learning from other R users, go to r-bloggers.com!\r\nFor the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.\r\nâ€• Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
