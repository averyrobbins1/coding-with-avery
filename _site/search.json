The main hurdle was figuring out how Hugo and blogdown worked, and now it is just getting the right words onto the page.\r\nThe inception of this website marks about two years since I started programming in R. I have long wanted to create a space to communicate to employers and others the value that I can provide. Even more important to me than that, I have wanted to share much of what I have learned about working with data in R, so that perhaps other people could benefit from my hundreds of hours spent staring at code that I think should work but doesn’t because I forgot a closing parenthesis.\r\nI love R, and I appreciate the things that people have done to add to the language. It is an extremely powerful environment for statistical analysis, reproducible work, and data wrangling & visualization. Ultimately, with this website I hope to share with you some knowledge and a plethora of useful tips with regards to R. All this in hopes to make your life a little bit easier.\r\nTruthfully, the creation of this website marks a great victory over procrastination. It has been rewarding to be able to check this off of the to-do list. Hopefully you are not reading this while procrastinating some project of your own. If you are, please stop! Go and do that thing that you know you should be doing! It is definitely worth it. Otherwise, feel free to check out one of my posts. Happy coding!\r\nIf you are both an R user and a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, check out my simple R package appa and have fun with transcript data from perhaps the greatest animated show ever created.\r\nIf you are interested in learning from other R users, go to r-bloggers.com!\r\nFor the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.\r\n― Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
