      <dc:creator>Avery Robbins</dc:creator>
      <link>https://codingwithavery.com/posts/2021-03-02-pins-and-friends</link>
      <description>No one likes sitting around waiting for code to finish running, and we may not have access to cloud computing options all the time. Even though we love R, we have to admit that it can be slow at times. Here are five different things that make dealing with computationally expensive operations in R more manageable (and maybe even more fun).</description>

      <title>PDF scraping can be easy, but data wrangling is often not!</title>
      <dc:creator>Avery Robbins</dc:creator>
      <link>https://codingwithavery.com/posts/2020-07-26-pdf-scraping-data-wrangling</link>
      <description>An inside look at some R code in the wild. This post is a clarification of a previous post: PDF scraping with R is easy! I changed easy to possible. While scraping data from PDFs can often be accomplished with just a few tools, wrangling the scraped data can often take time.</description>
